<h1>Static.module</h1>

<p class='intro'>Storage and retrieval of Drupal node content as
plain HTML files</p>
<h3>Intent:</h3>
<p>Every time a Drupal node is saved, a corresponding pure-XHTML
file is updated. This means that content can be retained even if the
database is unavailable.</p>
<p>It can be used to serve legacy content, create backups, or
provide alternate renderings of the pages via XSL or similar.</p>
<p>It's also handy for testing the metadata and microformat
retention as pages get round-tripped in and out the importer.</p>
<p>The static HTML dump attempts to be as 'vanilla' as possible,
retaining only the semantic content of a node. At the same time, it
serializes a bunch of 'metadata' extracted from Drupal (creator, date,
taxonomy keywords), and saves is as Dublin- Core- style 'meta' tags in
the file.</p>
<p>
The files will be saved as annotated XHTML in a designated directory
(configurable via admin/settings/static) with a filename corresponding
to its Drupal path - either the url alias+"htm" or "node/{n}.htm" depending on whether the node has a "path" set.
<p>NOT every bit of information will be saved this way, it is up to
additional modules to provide a way to save their custom data. None of
the non-core modules (or node types) are supported in this way yet.</p>
<p>Also, for the purposes of archiving, the proprietary Drupal
'input filters' may not survive the read/write round-trip process. The
HTML that is saved is 'cooked' and has had the appropriate filters
already applied. This means that reading them in again will retrieve the
already-filtered source, which will be valid, but no longer as dynamic.
token.module, reptag.module, image_assist.module or other markdown
filters will now be pure HTML. If you make extensive use of such
filters, you should not run static.module in read- write mode, only as
write-only.</p>
<p>When retrieval is set to aggressive (always read) or intelligent
(read if newer than node-modified date), the flat file will be read back
and displayed. This allows for HTML to be updated directly from outside
of Drupal.<br />
If left 'passive', Drupal node management continues as normal and the
static files are write-only, used for backup but not read back in again.</p>
<h3>Cross-linking</h3>
<p>
Maintaining relationships between [drupal nodes]-[drupal nodes], and [static files]-[static files] at the same time is problematic.
The true solution is probably to use something like Apache content-negotiation, but as we are intending to create a workable flat file archive, that's not going to help.
</p>
<p>
If your nodes refer to each other, the links will need to be re-made.
</p>

<h3>Using it to serve legacy pages</h3>
<p>This setup can be used to serve externally maintained HTML files
through a Drupal front-end. If, for instance you have a process that
writes to static HTML, this HTML can be forwarded through Drupal as a
node. If you wish to use a third party HTML editor and maintain your
content that way, static HTML will just work, although creating new
pages may be tricky.</p>
<p>In all cases, however, the input must be valid XHTML, and be of a
format compatable to the normal static HTML output. If it's not, then
each page read needs to pass through the reasonably intensive
import_html import template process. To enable this, check the 'advanced
import' in the settings.</p>
<p>Note that choosing to run the import_html process again will run
it with <em>all</em>em> the current configurations set, such as taxonomy
classification, user ownership etc.</p>
