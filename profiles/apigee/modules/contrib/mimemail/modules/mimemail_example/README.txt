-- SUMMARY --

  Mime Mail Example is a small module that provides one page where you
  can send an email using Mime Mail.

  This module can be used to test a site to verify that mail is set up properly,
  or it can be used during the development of Mime Mail to test operation of
  the module and/or try out bug fixes/new features. It also serves as an example
  of how to programmatically send e-mail with Mime Mail.

  To use, install the module then visit:

     /example/mimemail_example

  On this page you can enter information and attach a file, then press a button
  to send email using Mime Mail.

  This form is only available to users who have the "Send example email"
  permission. Be sure to grant this permission only to trusted users.

  To submit bug reports and feature suggestions, or to track changes, use the
  issue queue:
