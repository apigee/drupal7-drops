INTRODUCTION
============

Block Class allows users to add classes to any block through the block's
configuration interface. By adding a very short snippet of PHP to a theme's
block.tpl.php file, classes can be added to the parent <div class="block ...">
element of a block. Hooray for more powerful block theming!
